### Documentation
#### Vision Statement
> For the general public that cannot stand having their favorite show or movie spoiled, the AntiSpoil service provides a granular, on-demand web filter to hide content that may contain spoilers. AntiSpoil allows users to enter keywords or phrases relating to web content they do not want to see in order to give them a stress-free, spoiler-safe web experience. Rather than only hiding the user's keywords, AntiSpoil uses smart web-scraping technology to determine what sentences may contain words relating to the content users do not want to see. AntiSpoil will provide browser extensions for all major browsers to support multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
